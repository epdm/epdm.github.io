Cause Screening
---------------

Screening can be used to eliminate brainstorming and hypothesizing at the beginning
of a project. The project team first makes non-invasive observations of the
operation. They ignore everything in the middle, and only compare examples of
the very best and very worst outputs, searching for consistent differences.

The guidelines are simple:

* Any factor that is consistently different when the best and
worst outputs occur is deemed critical, and the team pursues it.
* Any factor that is not consistently different is deemed non-critical,
and the team ignores it.

With this screening process, practitioners non-invasively observe and review
data from the existing operation, and are usually able to separate the critical
and non-critical factors more quickly than with the traditional trial-and-error
approach.
