Tahuchi defines quality as the loss imparted by the product to society from the time the product is shipped. Quality loss occurs when a product deviates from target or nominal values.
Statistical methods developed to improve the quality of manufactures goods. Three principal contributions to statistics:
1. Specific loss function
L(x) = k(x-N)2

2. The philosophy of off-line quality control
3. Innovation in the design of experiments
Taguchi believed the best opportunity to eliminate variation is during the design of a product and its manufacturing process. Therefore he developed a strategy for quality engineering. There are 3 stages:
1. System Design - Conceptual level
2. Parameter (measure) design - nominal values of the various dimensions and design parameters need to be set. Robustification.
3. Tolerance design - With a successfully completed parameter design, and an understanding of the effect that the various parameters have on performance, resources can be focused on reducing and controlling variation in the critical few dimensions.
TAGUCHI ON QUALITY: Quality has been defined by many as; "being within specifications," "zero defects," or "customer satisfaction." However, these definitions do not offer a method of obtaining quality or a means of relating quality to cost. Taguchi proposes a holistic view of quality which relates quality to cost, not just to the manufacturer at the time of production, but to the customer and society as a whole (Phadke, 1989). Taguchi defines quality as, "The quality of a product is the (minimum) loss imparted by the product to the society from the time product is shipped" (Bryne and Taguchi, 1986). This economic loss is associated with losses due to rework, waste of resources during manufacture, warranty costs, customer complaints and dissatisfaction, time and money spent by customers on failing products, and eventual loss of market share. Figure-1 illustrates the loss function and how it relates to the specification limits. Presented at the 1991 Annual Conference of the International Society of Parametric Analysts. - 2 - LSL USL LOSS $ TARGET Figure-1; The Quadratic Loss Function When a critical quality characteristic deviates from the target value, it causes a loss. In other words, variation from target is the antithesis of quality. Quality simply means no variability or very little variation from target performance (Di Lorenzo, 1990). An examination of the loss function shows that variability reduction or quality improvement drives cost down. Lowest cost can only be achieved at zero variability from target. Continuously pursuing variability reduction from the target value in critical quality characteristics is the key to achieve high quality and reduce cost. Taguchi's quadratic loss function is the first operational joining of cost of quality and variability of product that allows design engineers to actually calculate the optimum design based on cost analysis and experimentation with the design (Teicholz, 1987).
