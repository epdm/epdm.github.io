The pertinent advantages of utilising Check Sheets for gathering data are as follows:

1. They are a quick, very easy and efficient means for recording desired information.
2. Information gathered can be either qualitative or quantitative.

Check Sheets can generally be used to:

1. Quantify defects by type, location, and cause (e.g. from a machine or
worker).
2. Keep track of the completion of steps in a multi-step procedure (i.e. be used
as a checklist).
3. Check the shape of the probability distribution of a process.
