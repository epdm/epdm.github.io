Relationship Between Quality and Reliability
--------------------------------------------

Quality assures the product will work after assembly, whereas reliability
relates to the probability that the design will perform its intended function for
a designated period of time under specified conditions. Engineering process
reliability is the fundamental concept that is meant to anticipate quality
failures over the life cycle of a product. Variation of the process output may
affect both quality and reliability. 

Controlling reliability is much more
complex and cannot be controlled by a standard "quality" (Six Sigma) approach,
as they need a systems engineering approach. Quality is a snapshot at the start
of life and mainly related to control of lower level product specifications and
reliability is (as part of systems engineering) more of a system level motion
picture of the day-by-day operation for many years. Time zero defects are
manufacturing mistakes that escaped quality control, whereas the additional
effects that appear over time are 'reliability defects'.
