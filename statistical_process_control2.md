Statistical Process Control
---------------------------

Statistical process control (SPC) is a method of quality control which uses statistical methods. SPC is applied in order to monitor and control a process. Monitoring and controlling the process ensures that it operates at its full potential. At its full potential, the process can make as much conforming product as possible with a minimum (if not an elimination) of waste (rework or scrap). SPC can be applied to any process where the "conforming product" (product meeting specifications) output can be measured. Key tools used in SPC include control charts; a focus on continuous improvement; and the design of experiments. An example of a process where SPC is applied is manufacturing lines. It uses a process of (physical) inspection to separate good products from bad.

Overview
* Objective analysis of variation
SPC must be practiced in 2 phases: The first phase is the initial establishment of the process, and the second phase is the regular production use of the process. In the second phase, a decision of the period to be examined must be made, depending upon the change in 4 - M conditions (Man, Machine, Material, Method) and wear rate of parts used in the manufacturing process (machine parts, jigs, and fixture)

* Emphasis on early detection
An advantage of SPC over other methods of quality control, such as "inspection", is that it emphasizes early detection and prevention of problems, rather than the correction of problems after they have occurred.

* Increasing rate of production
In addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product. SPC makes it less likely the finished product will need to be reworked.

* Limitations
SPC is applied to reduce or eliminate process waste. This, in turn, eliminates the need for the process step of post-manufacture inspection. The success of SPC relies not only on the skill with which it is applied, but also on how suitable or amenable the process is to SPC. In some cases, it may be difficult to judge when the application of SPC is appropriate.

The achievement of quality should not be considered as separate from the
achievement of production.

Identify product that is beyond reasonable quality control by many (3?) standard
deviations. This product has been produced by unusual circumstances - and that
should be traced and eliminated.

Argument: quality is conformance to requirement and can only be measured by the
cost of non-conformance.
