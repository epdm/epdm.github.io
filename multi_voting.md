Multi-voting
------------

Mutli-voting allows a group to narrow down a list of options into a manageable size for
further consideration. It is useful for initiating a selection process after
brainstorming. Multivoting is a group decision-making technique used to reduce a
long list of items to a manageable number by means of a structured series of
votes. The result is a short list identifying what is deemed important to the team.

Sometimes referred to as `N/3` voting - for `N` options, each member of the group
selects `N/3` of the options as a means for partial-ordering the options by
importance.

Multivoting Procedures:

* Step 1 - Work from a large list
* Step 2 - Assign letter to each item
* Step 3 - Vote
* Step 4 - Tally the votes
* Step 5 - Repeat
