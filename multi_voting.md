Multi-voting
------------

Allow a group to narrow down a list of options into a manageable size for
further consideration. Useful for initiating a selection process after
brainstorming.

Sometimes referred to as `N/3` voting - for N options, each member of the group
selects `N/3` of the options as a means for partial-ordering the options by
importance.
