Statistical Process Control
---------------------------

Initially developed during the second world war. Uses a process of (physical)
inspection to separate good products from bad.

* Developing control charts: a production process is in statistical control if
the chart's measurements vary (randomly in some distribution) within the control
limits
* Accepting sampling methods

The achievement of quality should not be considered as separate from the
achievement of production.

Identify product that is beyond reasonable quality control by many (3?) standard
deviations. This product has been produced by unusual circumstances - and that
should be traced and eliminated.

Argument: quality is conformance to requirement and can only be measured by the
cost of non-conformance.
