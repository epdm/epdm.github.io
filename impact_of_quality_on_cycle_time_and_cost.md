Impact of Quality on Cycle Time and Cost
----------------------------------------

These three project managment constraints are traditionally represented in
what is known as the "Iron Triangle", depicted in the figure below.

The relationship between the three constraints means that management staff
end up having to make a choice between two out of the three of them; in
other words, "Pick any two". This usually ends up with the three following
options:

* Designing a product to a high standard with a low time to market, at the cost of being expensive
* Designing a product quickly and at a low cost, at the expense of the product quality
* Designing a product to a high standard and at a low cost, but taking a long time to market.
