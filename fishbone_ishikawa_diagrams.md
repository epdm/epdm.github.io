Fishbone Ishikawa Diagrams
--------------------------

Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams) are causal diagrams that show
the causes of a specific event. Common uses of the Ishikawa diagram are product
design and quality defect prevention to identify potential factors causing an
overall effect. Each cause or reason for imperfection is a source of variation.
Causes are usually grouped into major categories to identify these sources of
variation. The categories typically include:

* People: Anyone involved with the process
* Methods: How the process is performed and the specific requirements for doing
it, such as policies, procedures, rules, regulations and laws
* Machines: Any equipment, computers, tools, etc. required to accomplish the job
* Materials: Raw materials, parts, pens, paper, etc. used to produce the final
product
* Measurements: Data generated from the process that are used to evaluate its
quality
* Environment: The conditions, such as location, time, temperature, and culture
in which the process operates

A typical, simplistic example of an Ishikawa diagram is presented below:

There have been identified topics for fishbone diagram cause classes in
different areas of development. They are grouped into easily remembered sets.
Examples are:

* The 5 M's (used in manufacturing industry):
    - Machine (technology)
    - Method (process),
    - Material (Includes Raw Material, Consumables and Information.),
    - Man Power (physical work)/Mind Power, Measurement (Inspection)

* The 8 P's (primarily used in service marketing industry):
    - Product/Service
    - Price
    - Place
    - Promotion
    - People/personnel
    - Process
    - Physical Evidence
    - Publicity.

* The 4 S's (used in service industry):
    - Surroundings
