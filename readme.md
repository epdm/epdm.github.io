How to markdown
===============

Markdown is a simple kind of text document that can be parsed to create a
formatted document.

Markdown should be edited in a standard text editor like gedit.

Paragraphs can be made by inserting a double line break.

* Bullet points can be made by starting lines with an asterix.
