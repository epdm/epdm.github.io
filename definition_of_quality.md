Definition of Quality
---------------------

**Quality** is a somewhat abstract, subjective quality with people
interpreting it differently. Like the 'theory of relativity' quality is
expressed as a relative concept and can be different things to different people.
For example: 


*"A Rolls Royce car is a quality car for certain customers whereas a VW Beatle
can be quality car for other customers."*


Therefore, consumers may tend to focus on the eventual specification quality of a product/service, or how it compares
with the competing companies in the marketplace. However, on the contrary,
producers might measure the conformance quality, or the degree to which the
product/service was produced correctly. The producer of a product may focus on
process variation minimisation, to achieve uniformity amongst and between
batches.


Five discrete and interrelated definitions of quality are listed below (Garvin,
1988):

* Transcendent (excellence);
* Product-based (amount of desireable attribute);
* User-based (fitness for use);
* Manufacturing-based (conformance to specification);
* Value-based (satisfaction relative to price);
