Definition of Quality
---------------------

Quality is a somewhat abstract, subjective quality. Consumers may tend to focus
on the eventual specification quality of a product/service, or how it compares
with the competing companies in the marketplace. However, on the contrary,
producers might measure the conformance quality, or the degree to which the
product/service was produced correctly. The producer of a product may focus on
process variation minimisation, to achieve uniformity amongst and between
batches.
