Software Process Improvement Tools
----------------------------------

A Software process is defined as the system of all tasks and the supporting
tools, standards, methods, and practices involved in the production and evolution
of a software product. TQM tools, such as Cause & Effect Diagrams, Pareto Charts and
Check Sheets can all be used to improve software processes.

One approach that can be used to improve a business' software process is the PDCA
cycle - Plan, Do, Check and Act (The role of Software Process Improvement into Total
Quality Management: an Industrial Experience, 2000). This approach can be split up into
the following four steps:

* Planning: involves the reviewing of data and information, establishing and documenting
action plans and their deployment in their specific areas.
* Do: involves the execution of the plans.
* Check: involves performing reviews in their specific areas, integrating leadership and lower
level departments.
* Act: involves implementing any system changes and the fulfillment of the goals, following
the reviews.
