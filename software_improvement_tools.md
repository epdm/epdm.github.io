Software Improvement Tools
--------------------------

Not exactly sure what this title means. Therefore I have just looked at software
you can use to use to improve TQM. In general I found a lot of articles which
seemed to mention the things below however I have noticed that these are being
covered by other people in the group.

* Cause and Effect Diagram
* Checksheet
* Control Chart
* Graphs (Run Chart)
* Histogram
* Pareto Chart
* Scatter Diagram



* Pathmaker: Seems to be a tool to help your team work more effectively, and not
anything to do with DoE I think the following two articles cover what this
section is looking for but I want to talk to Anthony about this.
