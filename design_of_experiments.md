Design of Experiments
---------------------

A method used to maximize the information obtained from experimental data
through very few trials or runs.

1. Full factorial
2. Fractional factorial
3. Taguchi Methods
4. RSM (Response Surface Methodology)

Benefits of DoE:

1. Quick, economical and efficient method to identify most significant input
factors
2. Simultaneous trials with multiple control factors instead of one variable at a
time.
3. Gives interaction effects of control factors / input factors.
4. Less number of trials required to get process insight.
5. Impact of control factors on response can be easily measured.
6. Explore relationship of response and control factors.
